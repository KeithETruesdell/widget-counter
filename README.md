A widget counter intended as a joke originally created by AlynxZhou.

## The Joke

- Chinese Version

	我看到 Hackghost 的桌面上有一个计数器，上面显示数字“233”，于是我好奇地去问他这个计数器代表什么意思。他回答说：“这个数字代表了我今天被蠢货们打断了工作的次数”。说完他又按了一下计数器按钮，于是现在数字变为“234”了。

- English Version Translated by AlynxZhou

	I saw a counter on Hackghost's desktop showing a number "233", and I asked him what it means curiously. He said "That represents how many times I was interrupted by idiots today". After speaking he pressed the button of the counter again, and then the number became "234".

## Usage

Click the counter on the status bar to add 1 and count a **WIDGET** you want to count, including your coding hours, your drinking times, times interupted, times your coworker coughed in your face, etc.  

You can edit the name of the counter to be more appropriate, or more discrete as well.  

It's a meta-counter that can count every thing you did with/without Atom, a hackable text editor for the 21st centery, with a hackable counter.
